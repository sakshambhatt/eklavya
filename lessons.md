These are the things that I discovered in CSS while making the component library
# Overflow:
Works only on block elements which have height defined
# Perfectly round border radius:
eqauls dimensions (width = height), border-radius: 50%

[W3Schools overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp)
# When I click on buttons/ input tags, an outline appears which is not removed if I set :active/ :focus border: none;
[outline, a CSS property](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1158515/difference-between-outline-and-border)
# Did you know that borders had sides? I didn't. In my input field, I use `border: none` and `border-bottom: 2px solid var(--dark);`
